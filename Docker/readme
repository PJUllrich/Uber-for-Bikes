The connection between the app and the database seems to work, can be tested by creating a new user or adding a remote bike.

Run the containers using 
(sudo) docker-compose up		(or start etc. depending on the state of the containers)
access the website via localhost:8080/UberForBikesWACC/		-> ports are forwarded

To deploy the latest version of the app, build the UberForBikesWACC.war artifact in the UberForBikesWACC/Docker directory.
Then run:  
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up

URL to access UberForBikes web app:
    http://localhost:8080/UberForBikesWACC_war/

In order to push (new) image to docker hub:
    1. Go to the UberForBikesWACC/Docker folder.
    2. Include the UberForBikesWACC.war file in the /Docker folder. Apparently files can only added to image if they are in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
    3. Execute the following commands:
        sudo docker build -t rugwacc23/uberweb:latest .  # The Dot in the end is important!
        sudo docker login
        sudo docker push rugwacc23/uberweb
